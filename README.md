# ObjectOrientedDesigPatterns

This repository is a code demonstration based on the design patterns from the famous book Design Patterns Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software written by the Gang of Four. Partially it is also based on the Pluralsight lectures in the path: Design Patterns in C#. My examples cobine the best of the two, and etends them further with my own examples.
