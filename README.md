# ObjectOrientedDesigPatterns

This repository is a code demonstration based on the design patterns, from the famous book, Design Patterns Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software written by the Gang of Four. Partially it is also based on the Pluralsight lectures in the path: Design Patterns in C#. In this project I use my own examples.
