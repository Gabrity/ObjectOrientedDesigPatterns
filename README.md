# ObjectOrientedDesignPatterns

This repository is a code demonstration based on the design patterns from the famous book: Design Patterns Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software written by the Gang of Four. Partially it is also based on the Pluralsight lectures in the path: Design Patterns in C#. This helps to put these patterns in a modern perspective. In this project I use my own examples to demonstrate the usefullness of the patterns based on my interpretation.

From the original 23 design patterns I am missing only the Interpreter, but there are some additional ones: ServiceLoactor, NullObject, Specification and Repository.
